In the spring come of the first month of April, I do my job as IT OPS. So far, the task was monitoring and managing some issues. Fun fact for the job, I guessing this will be a path to become better personal management. We hear from other people that, When we are live individuals or doing something that we need to be focus 100% full, we easily got distracted by other common things. So with this task or role that I doing in OPS, It will represent how do I manage some kind of my daily task. From the hardest one to the easiest one.

Iâ€™m so grateful for this position and hope I can keep up the good work.
