We often have some burnout or fatigue from our heavy workload. As we need to get more pace on work, sometimes we end up feeling so exhausted and sloppy. So, we might need to take care ourself first. Some study says we describe our conscious act in order to promote our own physical, mental and emotional health. 
There are many forms self-care may take. It could be ensuring that you get enough sleep every night or stepping outside for few minutes for some fresh air.

##What do I do
I rather do my task first as IT Ops. I often get more issues when things getting wrong or when the Apps has been crashed for more than 15 minutes in our system monitor. So, much to do that I need to take care of it. Even though that makes me so exhausted, I need to get things done quickly. After that, sometimes I get sloppy to finishing that issue. Lack concentration when our client meeting but as far as the problems go. It will end up nicely because we all need the problem goes fixed quickly. 

##The blocker
When I got mentally down and I don't know what to do. The first thing that I remember, I take a deep breath or sometimes take a sip of water. Then, breakdown every little problem into pieces. But if the mental block is shown how to feel that I don't any optional solution. I do remind myself about God who created us all and because I'm a Muslim, I've to pray 5 times per day. Hope that the problem will be solved little by little until it's done. So, that's why we need to calm ourselves and clear our minds first when the problem comes.

##Next up
I do need to learn how Physical self-care, Social self care, mental self-care, spiritual selfcare, and emotional self-care is all about. For necessary I might need to have a self-care development plan. 

##Gratitude
For all I've been through untill this month. I'll always need to keep thank. This note will always motivate me to self-care, and to self-develop in the future.
