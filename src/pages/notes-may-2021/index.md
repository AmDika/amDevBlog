Hi, It's has been a long time that I didn't publish any blog articles, yet. What am I to do back then was doing my work as an ops and getting involved on many issues. Besides fulfilling my duty, Sometimes I still doing code for practice solving any problem and of course for accomplishing my daily routine, too. Fun fact if you are a coder, The way we think based on code, sometimes it will represent how we or found a new way to think of our daily life.

But instead of focusing on the way I learn about code. I'm enrolling in some short courses on Coursera about "The Science of Well-Being" by Yale Univ. Why am I so interest in that short course, It's because I read about an article from my uncle, He is known as Lecturer in NTU(Nanyang Tech Univ) but while in his spare time, he wrote an article about psychology stuff. The title that I read is "Why I am a Slow Writer? The Science of Well-Being". So overall, the article is talking about the experience of the writer if the thoughts and emotions are not balanced he easily becomes distracted and uninspired. He told me what becoming well being is, but what I'm concern about is I need to understand finding mindfulness, etc, and of course taking a short course as recommended by him, too.

In the next article, I might be summarizing the short course of "The Science of Well Being". But for now, I need to keep my daily routine and focus on achieving my short goal, tho. I think that's it for this article, See ya in the next my daily notes. 
Thank you for reading my notes anyway.

Stay healthy.
