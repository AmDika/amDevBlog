## Prerequisites
Okay, so good evening everyone. I'm Aulia Dika. This is my first journal on this blog. Why I need this, it's because I need to keep on track of my daily goal. For today, I do have to continue practicing my JS code on Codecademy. Then I'll do check on MyXL Helpdesk if there is any email about ops that I missed from yesterday. 
Oya, For a project that I'm assigned for the last 3 months is MyXL OPS. I do have to monitor the traffic of new MyXL apps. Helping, and also answering about any bugs related to the apps. 
For any specific issue ticket, I do need to query some logs to get to know how I'll be solved to those user issue problems.

## Next Day
I still need to keep learn about all the tools of MyXL OPS use. And about the AWS insight log.

## Gratitude
For being in MyXL team OPS, I do have honor for giving me the trust to answer all the question issues related to new MyXL apps.
