##Notes
In the middle second month of 2021, I've been spent taking an online course and doing my task as an ops specialist. A little bit intermezzo, I have some interest about FE stuff especially React js Framework. It's because React have been updating their own version and gain more popularity as FE framework these days. But for me, I've been trying to use it about 2 years ago when I'm work at startup. I feel React it's making a new way to become an efficient framework for Frontend engineering. I still need more learning to get used by their new feature. I guess a lot more magic stuff in FE will coming these year. 

And for the Ops part, There has been so much new challenge problem that I face until now. Most of it is to answering the difficult problem that I haven't authorized in some specific area. I feel need to be more patient when the issues come to me. And meanwhile I've preparing to learn new way communicating to the team in different issues.

##Gratitude
I'm feeling bless and thankful to having much more learning time in this pandemic situation. A lot of these days must be harsh situation in many people on different countries. But I think this is the time that we all must concern about our persenal hygiene. Hope all the readers have to stay healthy.
