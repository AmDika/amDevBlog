##Notes
In the middle second month of 2021, I spent my time taking an online course and doing my task as an ops specialist. In fact, I have some interest in FE stuff especially React js Framework. It’s because React has been updating its own version and gain more popularity as an FE framework these days. But for me, I’ve been trying to use it for about 2 years ago when I’m working at a startup. I feel React it’s making a new way to become an efficient framework for Front-end engineering. I still need more learn to get used to their new feature. I guess a lot more magic stuff in FE will coming this year.I

And for the Ops part, There has been so much new challenge that I face until now. Mostly I answer problems where I am not authorized in a particular area. I feel need to be more patient when the issues come to me. And meanwhile, I’ve to prepare to learn new ways to communicate with the team on different issues.

##Gratitude

I’m feeling bless and thankful to having much more learning time in this pandemic situation. These days must be a harsh situation for many people in different countries. But I think this is the time that we all must concern about our personal hygiene. Hope all the readers have to stay healthy.
