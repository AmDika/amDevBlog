What I thought about become a professional engineer/developer. It's all about presistance and self-discipline. 

For quite long time I do feel like to become resistance from myself. Feeling trembling and strugling, Having not self-worthy so on and so forth. 

I know for quite sometime, I do must dealing with *emotional abuse*

Emotional abuse from someone can be so hard to deal especially in day to day work.
It's because so much challenge that you overly attached for this specific issue which is to be part of an engineer.
the things when you get on the team and make a role as team lead. You also become the mediator between the business and your devs. In some engineer or devs experiance, they told us that the primary task isn't actually coding but negotiating with the owner business which the client and various non-tech people then discussing why should you allowed certain things and your team want to do.

But after all, you might be end up feeling gloomy if you can't understand what the abuser wants. And just because you don't have the guts to do something that makes you breakthrough from your mental illness boundary. You just need to be the focus and be glad about what you have right now. Say that you still be alive, having food on your dinner time/lunch/breakfast, and having clothes on your body. By the way, it's okay not to be okay.
<!-- but I mean you need to embrace what weakness that you have for this time, then make it become your strength to move on. -->
