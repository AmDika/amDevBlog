Hello, end of June here. So last month, I'd really complicated stuff to do such as learn new programming languages like Swift, Kotlin etc. But I prefer to learn and fall in love with swift. It's not because I use MacBook for my daily jobs but rather to be flexible as a swift programming language to offer. Then, in the third week of June, I studied a lot more about swift programming language in Codecademy online learning platform. Just within 1 week I've done finished all the swift course.
In swift, we can add some additional state in front of a function which is a JS class that can't do the same tho. For example, we can mutate functions inside the class that we created for  

```
class someName {
	var items = (Int)[]

	init() {}

	mutating func push(_ item: Int) {
		/* inside func state */
		items.append(item)
	} 
}
```

As the above example, we may experience it if reference type whereas structure and enum are values type. And it's because The properties of the value type cannot be modified within its instance by default type. The first thing to know This method, It's makes my mind blown for about a week tho, And I still try to re-learn and adapt to those functions.

As July of 2021 comes. I'd hope that I'll keep learn and re-learn those new programming languages. And of course, still keeping a track record on my jobs as an OPS by now. 
Thanks again to all my reader. Bless you.
